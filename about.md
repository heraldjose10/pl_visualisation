## Dataset

For this project, I used the [Premier League 2022-2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/premier-league-2022-2023?select=epl_results_2022-23.csv) dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains match results of the 2022-2023 season of the English Premier League for every team. Match data includes names of teams, referees, and stats by home and away side such as fouls, shots, cards, etc. It also includes a dataset of the club's info such as team colours, abbreviation, and team logo image.

Kudos to [Evan Gower](https://www.kaggle.com/evangower) for making the dataset and publishing it on Kaggle.

## Tech Stack/Libraries

From my perspective, this project served as an experiment as I always wanted to use a JavaScript data visualization library. I decided to go with Recharts for this project due to its simplicity, native SVG support, and its foundation on the renowned data visualization library, [D3](https://d3js.org/). As of now, I find Recharts to be user-friendly for getting started; however, there are occasional frustrating issues that I have encountered. In my opinion, the documentation could have been better with more explanation.

In addition, I had my first experience using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Furthermore, the latest update to Next.js 13 brought significant improvements to the framework. The comprehensive documentation and strong community support for Next.js made it incredibly straightforward to incorporate into my project. I will use NextJs for my next project.
